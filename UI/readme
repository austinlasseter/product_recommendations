▶▶   The user interface of the project is done completely using Plotly Dash. 
* Dash is basically a platform by the renowned Plotly library,which many data scientists use as a User Interface.
* Dash uses Flask as the base framework and creates a web application where data scientists and analysts can display visualizations, text or any such asset. Dash is completely in Python so you do not have to worry about learning JavaScript. It is the nearest equivalent of the R Shiny platform.

🔎The dynamic interface is the interface that uses the model repeatedly for each and every recommendation. The product is sent to the model and recommendations are retrieved. The model itself is about 600 MB in size which makes the slug size of the product very large and hence cannot be deployed without using a cloud platform to save the model and assets. The dynamic interface can be used locally and will perform just as good.

🔎The static interface is the interface that is deployed on heroku. Since heroku supports applications of slug size not more than 500 mb, the results were calculated and stored in a python file instead of using the transfer learning model everytime for each image. It is faster but not very usable as large data results cannot be stored.
